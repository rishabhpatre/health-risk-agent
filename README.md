Room No: 8 — Packaged Food Ingredient Health Risk Advisor (Kids) 

Problem Context (100 words) 
Parents struggle to judge packaged foods with complex ingredient lists and additives. Today they manually Google ingredients, rely on marketing, or guess—often missing harmful additives, allergens, or high sugar/sodium risk. This is slow and error-prone, especially when assessing suitability for kids. 

One Primary Goal 
The agent’s goal is to rate a packaged food’s kid-health risk with reasoning, subject to ingredient evidence + allergy constraints + age guidelines, while optimizing for clarity and safety. 

Scope and Boundaries 

Allowed: parse label, classify additives, flag allergens, provide safer alternatives, explain risk factors. 

Stop/ask human: medical conditions, severe allergy profiles, conflicting label data. 

Out of scope: medical diagnosis/prescription. 

User Types 
Parents/caregivers; optionally pediatric nutritionist reviewer. 

Formal Conversation Samples 

Parent: “Is this cereal okay for 7-year-old?” → Agent flags sugar/additives → suggests alternatives. 

Parent: “Child has nut allergy.” → Agent checks allergen traces → advises caution + consult doctor.
